# Unsupervised-Anamoly-detection-using-Brain-MRI-images

Detection of lesions in Medical imaging is time-critical and error-prone. One of the demanding tasks is the detection of abnormalities in Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), which radiology experts often interpret. A decision assistance tool for segmenting and detecting lesions would be required to reduce the efforts of radiologists. Unsupervised anomaly detection is extensively studied in the field of Deep Learning, as this method uses healthy images for training rather than unhealthy ones, which are difficult to obtain. There have been studies on Variational Autoencoders (VAE), which utilize 2D brain slices. In this work, we have studied VAE, Vector quantized Variational Autoencoders (VQVAE), and Vector quantized Generative Adversarial Networks (VQGAN) in samplewise, slice-wise, and pixel-wise fashion, along with the effect of latent sizes on each model. Modelsâ€™ effectiveness on imagery other than brain imaging is evaluated.
